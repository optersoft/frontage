# TODO

Open work for `frontage`, most urgent first. `- [ ]` open, `- [x]` done where the reason is
worth keeping. The milestones themselves are in `DESIGN.md` §16; this file tracks the edges.

## Decisions taken by proposal on 2026-09-05 (say so if any should change)

All seven open decisions in `DESIGN.md` §17 were taken as proposed: MicroPython first-class;
template strings in M2 with the builder as fallback; pure Python first and a JS shim only
where the rows benchmark says so; Solid 1.x synchronous propagation; `Store` in 0.1;
accessors spelled `count()` with `.value` as alias; widgets as a subpackage.

## M0 (in progress)

- [x] `puepy-reference` branch; fork tree removed from `main`.
- [x] Skeleton: `runtime`, `errors`, `renderer` (seam + `HtmlRenderer` + `RecordingRenderer`),
      `view` (`h` builder, call and `with` forms, `render_to_string`).
- [x] `SPEC.md` with milestone tags.
- [x] Local PyScript fixture: `tools/fetch_pyscript.py` unpacks the offline bundle (core +
      Pyodide + MicroPython, 18 MB, no CDN); `tools/serve.py` serves it at `/pyscript/`.
- [x] Browser smoke test green under `mpy` and `py` (`tests/browser/test_smoke.py`). PyScript's
      offline mode resolves interpreters as `./pyscript/<name>/…` relative to the *page*, so
      `tools/serve.py` answers `/pyscript/` under any path and the site has a `_redirects` rule.
- [x] CI: the browser job fetches the bundle and caches it by the fetcher's hash.
- [x] CI ran on GitHub 2026-09-05: test 10 s, browser 41 s (bundle fetch included), both green.

## M1 (next)

- [x] `frontage/reactive.py`: Signal, Memo, Effect (two-phase), RenderEffect, batch, untrack,
      on, Owner, context, selector. SPEC §4 C1–C15; 30 unit tests; runs under MicroPython
      (the browser smoke exercises it).
- [x] `frontage/store.py`: SPEC §5 T1–T5, T7; 17 unit tests; runs under MicroPython.
- [x] Reactive views: holes with the insert rules, bound attributes (`attr`/`prop_`/`class_`/
      `style_`/`bind_`/`ref`), `component`, `Show`, `For` (identity, key function, index
      mode), `mount`; `DomRenderer` with delegated events. SPEC S5, W1–W7, W13 (partly:
      `currentTarget` is not simulated yet). 26 view tests through the recording renderer.
- [x] Counter and todo examples with browser tests, green under MicroPython and Pyodide.
      Three MicroPython differences met on the way, all now handled: functions have no
      writable `__name__`, code objects have no `co_argcount`, and `Owner.run` needed kwargs.
- [x] The rows example and `tools/bench.py` (§12). Baseline, node-by-node path, medians of 3,
      2026-09-05, this laptop's Chromium:

      | operation | MicroPython | Pyodide | renderer ops |
      |---|---|---|---|
      | create 1,000 rows | 198 ms | 111 ms | 32,000 |
      | update every 10th | 3.4 ms | 0.9 ms | 100 |
      | swap two rows | 18 ms | 2.5 ms | 2 |
      | append 1,000 | 207 ms | 166 ms | 32,000 |
      | clear 1,000 | 44 ms | 9.5 ms | 1,000 |

      Two fixes fell out of the first run: dependency tracking was a linear scan (quadratic
      for a For over 1,000 rows: swap was 328 ms on MicroPython), and list iteration in a
      Store subscribed to a node per index. Lesson for §12: on MicroPython, Python-level work
      is the bottleneck as much as bridge crossings; the For and reconcile paths must stay lean.
- [x] The Template path (S6, W17): an Element compiles to one HTML skeleton with `<!--h-->`
      markers and `data-fr-h` elements; one `clone_template` per instance, holes bound after;
      a `For` keeps one Template per row function and reuses it when the row's shape matches
      (static attributes included). Text children are holes so like rows share a template.
      Renderer ops per row 31 → 11. Medians of 3, 2026-09-05:

      | operation | mpy templates | mpy node-by-node | py templates | py node-by-node |
      |---|---|---|---|---|
      | create 1,000 | 169 ms | 177 ms | 77 ms | 100 ms |
      | append 1,000 | 182 ms | 192 ms | 90 ms | 154 ms |
      | swap | 16 ms | 18 ms | 2.6 ms | 2.4 ms |
      | update every 10th | 3.3 ms | 3.4 ms | 0.8 ms | 0.7 ms |

      Templates are the default on both. On MicroPython the win is small because Python-level
      work (Element construction, effects, signals) dominates, not bridge crossings; the JS
      shim of DESIGN §8.6 would take ~7 of the 11 ops per row (hole finding) and is deferred to
      the M5 performance pass together with a MicroPython profiling session.
- [ ] W13 leftovers: simulate `currentTarget`, `oncapture:`; W15 custom events.
- [ ] Redeploy the site with the new examples (index at `/examples/`).

## Outward-facing, for David

- [ ] Email PuePy's author about the fork and the rewrite (courtesy; nothing is owed).
- [x] `github.com/optersoft/frontage` is live (main, `puepy-reference`, tag `v0.0.1`); the PyPI
      trusted publisher is registered and **`frontage 0.0.1` is on PyPI** (2026-09-05). A tag
      pushed seconds after the repo's first push did not trigger a run; re-pushing it did.
- [ ] DNS: proxied CNAME `frontage -> frontage-a8x.pages.dev` in the optersoft.com zone; the
      Pages project has the domain attached and waits on it. Then connect the project to the
      GitHub repo and retire the hand deploy.
- [ ] Check `frontage.dev`.

## Site and docs

- [ ] The landing page still shows the M2 template syntax as if it ran today; fine as a
      target, but say "target syntax" until M2 lands. The deployed site still serves the
      fork's examples; redeploy (`mk site.deploy`) once M1 has real examples to show.
- [ ] Docs on academy at `/tool/frontage`, chapter per concept in `DESIGN.md` order, each with
      its live example; one interpreter per page for the embeds (§2b).
- [ ] The measured size of a MicroPython Frontage app, on the landing page (§2b).
